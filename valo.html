    VALORANT is a free-to-play first-person tactical shooter video game being developed and published by Riot Games.

It was announced on October 15, 2019 under the codename "Project A", until it was officially revealed as VALORANT on March 2, 2020. It was officially released on June 2nd, 2020 for PC.

By the time VALORANT reached its first anniversary, the game had 14 million active monthly players and Riot announced the game would soon be coming to mobile platforms, with console platforms also being explored but not as high a priority. There are no plans to enable cross-play between PC and mobile
